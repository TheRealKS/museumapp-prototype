            <h1>View of Haarlem from the Northwest, with the Bleaching Fields in the Foreground</h1>
            <h2>Jacob Isaacksz. van Ruisdael - c.1650 / c.1682</h2>
            <h5>oil on canvas - 43cm x 38cm</h5>
            <p class="art_description">Foreigners experience the flat Dutch landscape as having a straight, low horizon
                extending under a vast sky with billowing cumulus clouds. This is how Ruisdael painted the Haarlem
                skyline in the distance, recognizable by the high roof of St Bavoâ€™s. Lengths of cloth bleaching in the
                sun lie at the foot of the dunes in the foreground. The Haarlem linen industry relied on the pure dune
                water. </p>
