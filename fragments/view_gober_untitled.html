            <h1>Untitled Leg</h1>
            <h2>Robert Gober 1989 - 90</h2>
            <p class="art_description">As a copy of a man's leg and foot, this work is strikingly real: its fleshy waxen
                skin, clad in leather shoe and in cotton pant and sock, sprouts actual human hair. Exactness like this
                slides over into the unsettling, a macabre tone amplified by the leg's placement, its owner having
                presumably collapsed to the floorâ€”and then, too, he has only one leg, which issues from the wall, as if
                the architecture had eaten him. For some, it may also have a subtle fetishistic eroticism, inasmuch as
                it focuses on a narrow band of the body where men routinely and unselfconsciously show their nakedness.
